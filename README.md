## Current Status

### Text-to-Image
- **Status**: **Working**  
- The `Text-to-Image` generation is functioning as expected. Users can input a text prompt, and the application generates an image based on that prompt.

### Image-to-Image (img2img)
- **Status**: **Not Working**  
- The `Image-to-Image` (img2img) functionality, which should allow users to upload a reference image and generate a modified image based on that reference, is not functioning correctly. Although the image upload is successful and returns an `imageUUID`, the image generation process using the reference image is not working as expected. Further debugging and adjustments are required.
